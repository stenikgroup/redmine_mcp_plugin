# OAuth2 discovery documents for the MCP endpoint.
#
# Without these an MCP client cannot start an OAuth2 flow on its own. It posts
# to /mcp, gets 401, and has nowhere to look: the bare `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer
# realm="Redmine"` names no authorization server. So the recommended auth mode
# was reachable only by a human pasting a token in by hand.
#
# Two documents, both unauthenticated by necessity -- a client reads them before
# it has any credential:
#
#   RFC 9728  /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource[/mcp]  what protects /mcp
#   RFC 8414  /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server      where to get a token
#
# The second describes Redmine core's own Doorkeeper provider rather than
# anything this plugin implements. Redmine does not publish it, and a client
# that cannot find token_endpoint cannot proceed. Should a later Redmine start
# serving it, core's routes are drawn before plugin routes and core wins, which
# is the outcome we want.
class McpMetadataController < ApplicationController
  # A client has no session and no token at this point. That is the whole
  # purpose of these endpoints, and both documents are public by design: they
  # contain endpoint URLs and scope names, no per-user data.
